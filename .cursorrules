# DEGENQUEST SERVER RULES

## MOST IMPORTANT RULE
- ALWAYS kill all Node processes before starting server or client
- This prevents port conflicts and stale processes

## Server Commands
1. Kill all processes: taskkill /F /IM node.exe
2. Start server: cd apps/game-client; npm run server-dev
3. Start client: cd apps/game-client; npm run client-dev
