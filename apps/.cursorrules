# DEGENQUEST SERVER MANAGEMENT RULES

## MOST IMPORTANT RULE
- ALWAYS kill all Node processes before starting the server or client
- This prevents port conflicts and stale processes

## Server Commands
# Kill all node processes FIRST (do this EVERY TIME):
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Start the server:
cd apps/game-client; npm run server-dev

# Start the client:
cd apps/game-client; npm run client-dev
