# Migration from pnpm to Bun

This document outlines the migration from pnpm to Bun for the game client build process.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the CI/CD pipeline to use Bun instead of Node.js and pnpm
2. Replaced pnpm's build process with Bun's native build capabilities
3. Updated CircleCI configuration to reflect these changes

## Benefits

- **Faster Build Times**: Bun's build process is significantly faster than pnpm+webpack, especially on ARM64 architecture
- **Simplified Workflow**: The new CI/CD process is simpler and more maintainable
- **Reduced Dependencies**: No need for separate webpack installation and configuration
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bun uses less memory during builds, important for CI environments

## Before vs After

Before:
- Build time on ARM64: ~239 seconds
- Build time on AMD64: ~47 seconds

After (expected):
- Build time on ARM64: ~60-90 seconds (60-75% reduction)
- Build time on AMD64: ~20-30 seconds (30-40% reduction)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise with the Bun-based build:

1. Revert the CircleCI configuration to use the previous build process
2. Re-run the CI/CD pipeline to verify functionality

## Future Improvements

- Consider migrating the server build process to Bun as well
- Explore Bun's bundling capabilities for further optimization
- Update development workflows to use Bun locally
