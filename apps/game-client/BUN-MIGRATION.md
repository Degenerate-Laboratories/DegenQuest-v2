# Migration from pnpm to Bun

This document outlines the migration from pnpm to Bun for the game client build process.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the Dockerfile to use Bun instead of Node.js and pnpm
2. Replaced pnpm's build process with Bun's native build capabilities
3. Updated CircleCI configuration to reflect these changes

## Benefits

- **Faster Build Times**: Bun's build process is significantly faster than pnpm+webpack, especially on ARM64 architecture
- **Simplified Workflow**: The new Dockerfile is simpler and more maintainable
- **Reduced Dependencies**: No need for separate webpack installation and configuration
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bun uses less memory during builds, important for CI environments

## Before vs After

Before:
- Build time on ARM64: ~239 seconds
- Build time on AMD64: ~47 seconds

After (expected):
- Build time on ARM64: ~60-90 seconds (60-75% reduction)
- Build time on AMD64: ~20-30 seconds (30-40% reduction)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise with the Bun-based build:

1. Revert the Dockerfile to the previous version
2. Revert the CircleCI config to remove the Bun-specific comment
3. Run the original Docker build command to verify functionality

## Future Improvements

- Consider migrating the server build process to Bun as well
- Explore Bun's bundling capabilities for further optimization
- Update development workflows to use Bun locally
