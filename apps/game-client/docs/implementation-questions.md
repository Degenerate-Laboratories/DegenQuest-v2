# Key Questions for First-Person Implementation

Before proceeding with the implementation, the following questions need to be addressed:

## 1. Player Model Visibility

The current implementation shows the full player model in third-person view. For first-person view, we need to decide:

- **Should the player model be completely invisible to the player?**
  - This is simpler to implement but less immersive
  - Common in many first-person games

- **Should we show parts of the player model (hands, arms, etc.)?**
  - This is more immersive but requires additional modeling work
  - Would need to create or adapt first-person arm models
  - Requires setting up proper rendering layers to only show relevant parts

- **Should we render the player's body when looking down?**
  - This increases immersion but adds complexity
  - Would need proper alignment with the camera

## 2. Mouse Controls

In the current implementation, the middle mouse button is used for camera rotation. For a first-person experience:

- **Should we change to use standard first-person controls?**
  - Left mouse button for interaction
  - Right mouse button for alternative actions or aiming
  - Mouse movement for looking around without requiring button press

- **How should we handle mouse sensitivity and inversion options?**
  - Should add configuration options for mouse sensitivity
  - Consider adding option for inverted vertical look

## 3. Interaction System

The current system uses direct clicking on objects:

- **How should objects be selected in first-person view?**
  - Crosshair in center of screen
  - Raycast from center for interactions
  - Visual feedback when hovering over interactable objects

- **What feedback should be provided for interactable objects?**
  - Change crosshair appearance
  - Highlight object outlines
  - Show tooltips or prompts

## 4. Movement Controls

The current movement system is designed for third-person navigation:

- **How should movement adapt to first-person perspective?**
  - WASD controls relative to camera direction
  - Rotation of player should follow camera horizontally
  - Consider adding sprint functionality (possibly using the former zoom control)

## 5. Combat and Targeting

If the game includes combat mechanics:

- **How should targeting work in first-person?**
  - Should enemies be targeted by looking at them?
  - Will abilities still use the hotbar or involve aiming?
  - How will ranged and melee combat work in first-person?

## 6. UI Adjustments

The current UI is designed for third-person view:

- **What UI elements need repositioning or redesigning?**
  - HUD elements might need to be moved to edges of screen
  - Consider more immersive UI that feels integrated with first-person view
  - Health, abilities, and other status indicators may need new positions

## 7. Performance Considerations

First-person view may have different performance characteristics:

- **Are there performance optimizations specific to first-person view?**
  - Potentially narrower view frustum
  - Different level of detail requirements
  - Different culling strategies

## 8. Optional Toggle

It may be useful to allow players to switch views:

- **Should we implement a toggle between first and third person?**
  - Adds flexibility for players
  - Requires maintaining both camera systems
  - Needs clear transition between the two modes

## 9. Animations

The current animation system is designed for third-person view:

- **How should animations work in first-person view?**
  - What animations should be visible to the player
  - First-person arm animations for actions
  - How will equipment and items appear in first-person view

## 10. Multiplayer Considerations

If this is a multiplayer game:

- **How will other players see the first-person player?**
  - Ensure animations and model are properly visible to others
  - Make sure network updates are appropriate for first-person control
  - Consider any additional data that needs to be synchronized
