# Implementation Roadmap: 3rd Person to 1st Person Conversion

This roadmap outlines the suggested implementation order for converting the game from third-person to first-person view.

## Phase 1: Basic First-Person Camera Setup

**Priority: High**
**Estimated Effort: Medium**

1. **Modify PlayerCamera.ts**
   - Update camera position to be at player's eye level
   - Remove the backward offset from the camera
   - Adjust rotation to look forward instead of at the player

2. **Update Camera Controls**
   - Modify the camera control system to handle first-person style look controls
   - Implement vertical look limits to prevent camera flipping
   - Ensure camera movements feel smooth and responsive

3. **Hide Player Model**
   - Initially hide the player model completely (simplest approach)
   - Ensure other players can still see the player model correctly

4. **Basic Testing**
   - Ensure basic movement and camera controls work
   - Fix any immediate issues with camera clipping or movement

## Phase 2: Input and Interaction System

**Priority: High**
**Estimated Effort: Medium to High**

1. **Update Input Handling**
   - Modify PlayerInput.ts to handle first-person style controls
   - Implement standard WASD + mouse look controls without requiring button press
   - Update the movement calculations to be relative to the camera direction

2. **Implement First-Person Interaction**
   - Create/update the interaction system to use center-screen raycast
   - Add a crosshair to the center of the screen
   - Implement highlighting for interactable objects

3. **Update Player Movement**
   - Ensure player rotation follows camera horizontal rotation
   - Update movement calculations in PlayerInput.calculateVelocityForces()
   - Test movement in combination with the new camera system

## Phase 3: UI and Feedback Enhancements

**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Effort: Medium**

1. **Update HUD and UI Elements**
   - Adjust positioning of UI elements for first-person view
   - Ensure UI elements don't obstruct the player's view
   - Add first-person specific UI elements (crosshair, etc.)

2. **Improve Interaction Feedback**
   - Implement visual feedback when hovering over interactable objects
   - Add tooltip or prompt system for interactions
   - Ensure entity nameplates work well with first-person view

3. **Add Camera Effects**
   - Implement optional camera effects for movement and actions
   - Add subtle head bob during movement (optional)
   - Consider FOV changes for running or special actions

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Refinement

**Priority: Medium to Low**
**Estimated Effort: High**

1. **First-Person Body Awareness (Optional)**
   - Implement visible arms/weapons if desired
   - Set up rendering layers so only parts of the player model are visible
   - Ensure animations work correctly in first-person view

2. **Combat System Updates**
   - Update targeting system for first-person
   - Modify ability targeting if needed
   - Ensure combat feedback is appropriate for first-person

3. **View Switching (Optional)**
   - Implement the ability to toggle between first and third person views
   - Ensure smooth transition between the two views
   - Handle UI and control changes when switching views

## Phase 5: Optimization and Polishing

**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Effort: Medium**

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize rendering for first-person view
   - Implement appropriate culling strategies
   - Ensure the game maintains good performance in first-person

2. **Bug Fixing**
   - Address any camera clipping issues
   - Fix interaction problems in edge cases
   - Ensure multiplayer synchronization works correctly

3. **Final Polishing**
   - Refine camera movement and controls for best feel
   - Adjust sensitivity and other parameters based on testing
   - Create configuration options for camera sensitivity, FOV, etc.

## Implementation Notes

- **Testing Throughout**: Each phase should include thorough testing
- **Incremental Approach**: Implement and test one component at a time
- **Fallback Options**: Maintain the ability to revert to third-person if critical issues arise
- **User Feedback**: If possible, gather user feedback during implementation

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The player can navigate and interact with the world in first-person view
2. Controls feel natural and responsive
3. The UI and feedback systems are appropriate for first-person
4. Performance is comparable to or better than the third-person view
5. All game mechanics function correctly in first-person perspective
