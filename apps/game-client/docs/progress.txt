# Progress Tracker

## First-Person Controls Implementation

### Completed:

#### Mouse Look System
- ✅ Implemented proper first-person mouse look without right-click requirement
- ✅ Added mouse sensitivity adjustment with dynamic scaling
- ✅ Fixed rubber-banding issue by properly resetting movement values
- ✅ Added pointer lock support with proper user notifications
- ✅ Ensured proper updating of rotation values for both camera and player entity

#### WASD Movement System 
- ✅ Fixed inverted W/S controls to match expected first-person behavior
- ✅ Fixed inverted A/D controls for proper strafing relative to player orientation
- ✅ Improved movement stopping to eliminate lag/delay when keys are released
- ✅ Added robust debug logging for movement calculations
- ✅ Ensured server is notified immediately of movement state changes

#### Documentation
- ✅ Created troubleshooting guide for first-person controls
- ✅ Documented movement calculations and debugging techniques

### In Progress:

- 🔄 Fine-tuning mouse sensitivity values
- 🔄 Watching for any remaining movement/orientation bugs

### Planned:

- 📋 Add UI element to adjust mouse sensitivity
- 📋 Add options for inverting vertical look
- 📋 Consider adding sprint functionality (shift key)
- 📋 Implement proper camera bobbing for more immersive walking
- 📋 Add optional auto-run toggle (like MMOs)

## Known Issues:

- ⚠️ Mouse sometimes needs multiple clicks to lock in some browsers
- ⚠️ Need to verify WASD movement calculations work in all camera orientations
