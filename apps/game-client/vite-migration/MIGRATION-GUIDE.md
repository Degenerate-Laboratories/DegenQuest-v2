# Webpack to Vite Migration Guide

This document outlines the steps needed to migrate the game client from Webpack to Vite.

## Migration Steps

1. Copy all files from the `vite-migration` directory to the project root:
   - `vite.config.ts`
   - `index.html` (move to root, not public)
   - Updated `package.json`
   - Updated `vercel.json`

2. Install the new dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -D vite@latest
   ```

3. Remove webpack-related dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server webpack-merge copy-webpack-plugin ts-loader webpack-bundle-analyzer dotenv-webpack
   ```

4. Delete webpack configuration files:
   ```bash
   rm webpack.common.js webpack.dev.js webpack.prod.js
   ```

5. Test the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run client-dev
   ```

## Benefits of Vite

- **Faster Build Times**: Vite uses esbuild for pre-bundling dependencies and provides native ESM-based HMR
- **Improved Development Experience**: Lightning-fast hot module replacement
- **Simplified Configuration**: More intuitive setup compared to webpack
- **Better Tree-Shaking**: Improved dead code elimination in production builds
- **Native TypeScript Support**: No need for separate TypeScript loaders

## Vercel Deployment

The updated Vercel configuration recognizes the project as a Vite application, which enables:

- Optimized build process for Vite applications
- Automatic handling of ESM modules
- Improved caching strategies
- Faster deployment and startup times

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise with the Vite-based build:

1. Revert to the previous webpack configuration files
2. Restore the original `package.json`
3. Reinstall the webpack dependencies
4. Update the `vercel.json` file to use webpack again

## Performance Comparison

| Metric              | Webpack      | Vite (Expected) |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Development Startup | 10-15s       | 1-2s            |
| Hot Reload Time     | 2-3s         | <300ms          |
| Production Build    | 60-240s      | 15-60s          |
| Bundle Size         | Comparable   | Comparable      |
