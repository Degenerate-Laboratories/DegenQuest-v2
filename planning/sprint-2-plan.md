# Sprint 2 Planning Document

## Overview

Based on our experience and learnings from Sprint 1 (Milestone 1), this document outlines our plan for Sprint 2. The focus will be on building upon our newly established ES Module foundation to implement core gameplay features while avoiding the technical debt that slowed us down in Sprint 1.

## Sprint 1 Retrospective

### What Went Well
- Successfully migrated the codebase to ES Modules
- Fixed critical server startup issues
- Established proper TypeScript configuration
- Created comprehensive documentation for future development

### What Could Be Improved
- More systematic approach to problem-solving needed
- Better understanding of library compatibility with ES Modules required
- More thorough testing of changes before proceeding

## Sprint 2 Goals

1. **Core Game Mechanics Implementation**
   - Character movement and controls
   - Basic combat system
   - Item interaction
   - NPC dialogue system

2. **Multiplayer Stability**
   - Improve network synchronization
   - Handle disconnections gracefully
   - Implement latency compensation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Asset loading improvements
   - Rendering pipeline optimization
   - Memory usage monitoring

4. **Content Creation**
   - Design first playable level
   - Create core game assets
   - Implement storyline progression

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Modular Component System**
   - Create a component-based architecture for game entities
   - Ensure all components follow ES Module patterns
   - Implement proper dependency injection

2. **State Management**
   - Centralize game state management
   - Implement proper state synchronization between client and server
   - Add state validation on server side

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up unit testing for core game logic
   - Implement integration tests for client-server communication
   - Create automated performance benchmarks

### Implementation Plan

#### Week 1: Foundation Building

| Day | Task | Assignee | Estimated Time |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|
| 1   | Set up component system | Lead Dev | 1 day |
| 2   | Implement basic player controller | Gameplay Dev | 1 day |
| 3   | Create state synchronization system | Network Dev | 2 days |
| 4-5 | Implement basic UI framework | UI Dev | 2 days |

#### Week 2: Core Mechanics

| Day | Task | Assignee | Estimated Time |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Implement combat system | Gameplay Dev | 2 days |
| 1-3 | Create inventory system | Systems Dev | 3 days |
| 3-4 | Build NPC interaction framework | Gameplay Dev | 2 days |
| 4-5 | Implement quest system | Content Dev | 2 days |

#### Week 3: Content & Polish

| Day | Task | Assignee | Estimated Time |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Create first playable level | Level Designer | 2 days |
| 1-3 | Implement core game assets | Art Team | 3 days |
| 3-4 | Add sound effects and music | Audio Engineer | 2 days |
| 4-5 | Performance optimization | Performance Engineer | 2 days |

#### Week 4: Testing & Refinement

| Day | Task | Assignee | Estimated Time |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Implement automated tests | QA Engineer | 2 days |
| 1-3 | Conduct user testing | UX Researcher | 3 days |
| 3-4 | Bug fixing and refinement | All Devs | 2 days |
| 5   | Release preparation | Lead Dev | 1 day |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| ES Module compatibility issues | High | Medium | Apply lessons from Sprint 1, use type assertions where needed |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | High | Regular profiling, incremental optimization |
| Art asset bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Prioritize functional placeholders first, then replace with final assets |
| Scope creep | High | High | Strictly prioritize features, maintain issue tracking discipline |

## Technical Debt Management

To avoid accumulating technical debt as in Sprint 1:

1. **Code Quality Standards**
   - All code must pass linting before merging
   - Pull requests require code review from at least one team member
   - Maintain consistent formatting and naming conventions

2. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Document all new public APIs
   - Update architecture diagrams for significant changes
   - Add tests for all new features

3. **Refactoring Plan**
   - Dedicate 10% of sprint time to addressing technical debt
   - Prioritize refactoring that improves performance or maintainability

## Definition of Done

A feature is considered "done" when:

1. Code is written and properly follows ES Module patterns
2. Unit tests are written and passing
3. Feature is documented
4. Code has been reviewed
5. Feature works on all target platforms
6. Performance meets target metrics

## Sprint 2 Success Criteria

Sprint 2 will be considered successful if:

1. Players can move, fight, and interact with the game world
2. Multiplayer functionality is stable with at least 4 concurrent players
3. First playable level is complete and performant
4. All critical bugs are fixed

## Conclusion

By learning from our experience in Sprint 1, we are now better prepared to implement core gameplay features while maintaining good technical practices. Our focus on modularity, testing, and performance will ensure that we build a solid foundation for future development.
